AstraZenca,Former Employee , Internal Communications ,"Gaithersburg, MD",Working at this company made me realize exactly the kind of company culture I would never want to work in.,"Although the compensation and on-campus perks are amazing, they do not make up for the stress, anxiety and disrespect I endured while working here as a Black woman. Just weeks after I was hired, my bosses and team started criticizing me for not meeting expectations which were never communicated to me, although I was not properly onboarded and was not provided the proper training on team processes or expectations. 

I would get reprimanded for little things, like not replying right away to acknowledge that I had received emails, or not telepathically knowing that ""get this done whenever you can"" actually means ""get this done yesterday."" Somehow, my peers could get away with spontaneously taking the afternoon off, but when I announced any planned time-off two days in advance, I was told that I was taking ""too much time-off."" 

Slowly, the narrative was changing--I was no longer a competent communications professional, but an ""inept, consistently absent"" employee, even though I hadn't taken any more time-off than my white peers. 

I constantly felt as if I had to prove myself, prove that I belonged. When I was away from my workstation, my team would sometimes bad-mouth me within earshot of other workers. If I had to leave the office a little early, the comments included, ""Where is she going this time?"" My manager was once overheard saying that I ""always have doctor's appointments."" I should clarify here that at the time that I was hired for this role, I had well over 15 years of experience and a proven track record of meeting deadlines and delivering excellent work, and was simply trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. 

When I tried reaching out to former managers and mentors for support, I was told that they didn't want to get involved.

Eventually, I quit due to increasing anxiety, stress and burnout. And when I did, several other Black colleagues came out of the woodwork to confide in me how poorly treated they had been for many years. To this day, I have a few friends of color who still work there and who are still experiencing the worst forms of microaggressions and sometimes outright racism.

1.  AZ leadership, global and US, lacks:  Vision, Accountability, Self-Awareness, Sense of Purpose, Creativity, Authenticity, Humility, Passion, & Courage
2.  AZ is nothing more than a reach & frequency company that can't get out of its own way regardless of area:  Commercial, R&D, Distribution, HR, you name it it's broken here
3.  AZ isn't interested in selling (if you're looking for a sales / account management / sales leadership position) so much as it is sales.  If you're looking for a Commercial / Field Sales role of some sort don't worry about being qualified or over qualified as the first isn't something in which the company is interested and the second is a given regardless of employment background or tenure.
4.  AZ would prefer not to hire or retain the employment of intelligent, self-motivated, business minded, self-aware Commercial representatives as it works against their model of hire people who can provide in person TV ads.
5.  AZ lives and perpetuates a culture of corporate nepotism which would be less offensive if those benefiting from such a culture weren't such horribly incompetent choices
6.  AZ lives and perpetuates a culture of bias.  Be it gender on gender, gender against gender, competency bias, sexual orientation bias, you name it the bias culture is prominent and in the Commercial organization and not likely to change because of its culture of corporate nepotism
7.  Career advancement opportunities are finite; being a sycophant does help though
8.  Salary / bonuses fall grossly below industry average
9.  In large part it was embarrassing and remains to be for those still at AZ, to admit to others in the same industry that AZ is where one works as it is widely viewed as one of the most incompetent organizations filled, top to bottom, with people who just aren't very bright or their intellect has been put to work in an area all wrong for employee & employer

AstraZenca,,Current Employee ,,"This is the 5th company I have worked for, I can honestly say that AZ is my favorite.  The reason is simple - the company treats people first, both patients and also employees, and it shows in the culture. 

They do their best to help employees understand the life-changing medicines/impact that is made on patients, which helps make work more meaningful. The benefits here are also superb - besides good basic things like insurance, 401K and stuff, there are also a lot of on site perks that people can use (like fitness center, massage therapist, cafe, daycare center etc etc - not all free though.)

One thing that AZ stands out most, among other pharmas that I've worked for:  Although the Pharma industry is hitting some roadblocks, and every similar company has to make tough decisions, AZ's leadership teams make these decisions as ""humanely"" as possible, which I respect. Unlike all other companies that I've worked for, which essentially just treats employees like $ against the bottom line - that is not the case at AZ). But this caring/humane culture is trickled throughout the company - I can genuinely say that 99% of the people I work with are nice people (collaborative, and willing to go out of their way to help) - which says a lot about the culture and is VERY rare. 

Finally to those of you considering a career at AZ, I would recommend this company. Besides the reasons I mentioned above, AZ has many internal opportunities and they encourage people to develop their career and explore opportunities internally to fulfill their goals. So if you are looking to grow and build a career, AZ is a good place to do so.","For the reasons mentioned in the Pros - also becomes part of the Cons. Because the company is great, a lot of people here are ""lifers"" - they have been here for decade(s). Although this can be good since there is knowledge/nice culture retained, I can't help but feel that there is an overall resistance to change. Also because the company is so large/established and with so many processes defined, the company itself is also difficult to change (not nimble).

There is also a fair amount of politics going on at the management level (and many ""Yes-mans""). Unfortunately that seems to be everywhere, I would not say this place is the worse, but it is not the best in that regards. It does cause some subtle tension between some functions.

Benefits aren't bad.

If you are recently graduated and just need a few years experience to make your resume viable, you can get in here easily due to high turnover.","Performance is entirely uncoupled from reward and punishment. 

Who you know is everything - it's the difference between getting a slap on the wrist for a serious offence, or getting the hand lopped off for a more minor infraction.

For the most part, people honestly have the best intentions - but they consistently aren't given the tools or time to take a project through to completion, leading to half-implemented systems that hamstring the people forced to use them.

Communication from leadership is so poor that literally hundreds of man-hours can be devoted to an improvement project that becomes obsolete within two weeks of implementation, even if the obsolescence was know and planned for with 8 months of lead time. As you can imagine, this leads to frustration and lack of motivation.

Increasingly, the only winning strategy is to avoid attention - any decision is a bad one, so you must avoid having to make decisions at any cost, either by passing the buck or ducking opportunities for input.

Trying to bring problems to the attention of management is risky at best - odds are worse than 50/50 that you will be warned or punished for rocking the boat, vs. having any action taken on the issue.

We were told to keep working, while government was encouraging employees to evacuate and stay safe.

I don't know what life is like in other departments and I understand that lower level Scientist jobs can be frustrating and mundane, but I really don't understand some of the reviews I read for this company and I don't know what the folks complaining actually want.  Coming from academia, I know what no work-life balance is, and Medimmune is luxurious.  I never see anyone here after 6 (other than other research junkies) and on weekends you could set off a fire alarm and I think 5 people would appear.  Management encourages work-life balance and we get bombarded with emails about how to take care of ourselves.  They regularly do surveys on what we want to improve things, and act on it if possible (like dry cleaning, the fitness center, an ATM with no fees,  in chair massage services,  a medical clinic, a metro shuttle service). Then half the time, nobody ever uses them (though they complain if its taken away of course).  The metro shuttle service was fantastic but we lost it because hardly anyone used it and it turned out it would cost the company less to bring us here in cabs every day.   To their credit though, they really did give the service every chance and in the end arranged a compromise that, while not as good, is better than nothing.  

I realise a lot of the really dissatisfied reviews comes from Associates scientists who want to advance, but I have limited sympathy after years of hard work and low wages completing a PhD and post-doctoral training.  There are plenty of very capable nurses who could easily do the job of a physician, but life doesn't work like that.  If you want that job, go off and get the qualification like we did.  Yes, there are senior folks in research (exceptionally good ones) that did not get PhDs, but those days are over.   

Like all of Pharma, Medi is struggling with finances but they are doing their best to keep the sacrifice sensible and equitable.  There was a huge amount of fat here that was ready to be trimmed from what I could see and we are now getting things done far more efficiently than even 6 months ago.  I really think a lot of people who have worked in industry a long time are spoiled from some good years and don't know how hard life is in the rest of the world of science.

Though it's fair to say the quality of life here is very manager-dependent.  If you report to someone good, your life is a dream, if not you're screwed.  There's not much back up or escape in this regard, but it's a big enough company that you can move internally, and folks who aren't happy should do that as the manager gets flagged if too many people leave their group.

AstraZenca,,Senior Manager ,"Waltham, MA","AstraZeneca is a very healthy organization which understands the present and upcoming challenges the company and industry face. The company has build a solid foundation of guiding principles and has a clear and simple vision. The company leaders understand how important the people are and treat them accordingly. There are several employee recognition programs as well as generous benefits. Some of the benefits include matching 401K, comprehensive health, dental and vision insurance, tuition reimbursement and other great benefits. The employees of AstraZeneca provide a very welcoming, friendly and inclusive atmosphere and I find that I am treated like family more than just another employee. AstraZeneca also does a lot for the surrounding communnities of each site. Employees get involved in volunteer opportunities during working hours. Other great aspects of working at AZ are the opportunities for growth and promotion, there are many great leadership training seminars and on-line self paced training, and AZ has a tendency to promote from within. AstraZeneca develops leaders and provides many great opportunities.","The downsides of working for AZ are the same as working for many large corporations, there is a level of beauracracy when trying to get things done.",21-Sep-08,I have been working at AstraZeneca ,"""A great place to work, and a great company to work for.""",5

Plenty of opportunities to try new career paths 
Good for building an entry level career, lots of exposure to novel technology","Too many to mention but here's a short list (in no particular order):
Senior leaders have managed to create a fear culture that permeates most of the company. You can see this most in governance interactions, which are more like a Victorian schoolroom rather than an environment where all viewpoints are valued. The AZ values are quite a decent framework of behaviour that all employees should follow. Unfortunately these values seem to be for underlings only, don't expect them to be displayed by senior leaders in the majority of cases.
Workload in many functions is quite frankly ridiculous. If you don't work on evenings and weekends you apparently aren't performing your role effectively.
I've worked for many companies over two decades and I have to say that the frequency of individuals with massive egos is by far the most I've seen. This makes doing your day job all that more difficult. To be fair there are some great people too (all suffering).
ZERO pension contributions from the company (you have to contribute it all yourself). Bonus is calculated on a lower 'base salary' value and not on what you would consider your normal salary.
Performance review process is onerous and it can and will be used to unfairly beat you with by certain managers (usually those with the massive egos).
Turnover of staff is unmanageable, the 'revolving door' just won't stop. This adds to workload, reduces project knowledge and makes resourcing almost impossible.
The lack of process is astonishing. Good if you are a free thinking spirit who likes to make it up as you go along but bad if you need to learn the job and work in a highly regulated environment.",5-Mar-20,I have been working at AstraZeneca full-time for more than 5 years,"""Successful company but falls very short of being a great place to work""",2

Work life balance and benefits are pretty good.  Compensation is average.  Facilities are managed quite well.  Free snacks are available though that may change once the new cafeteria is ready.,"By far the biggest drawback is the toxic work culture and weak management.  There are a number of managers who do not have their employees' back, leaving them to fend for themselves until they either become toxic themselves as a survival mechanism, or leave the company in time so that self-healing can begin.

Politics is par for the course - yet it is the intensity level that takes it to a whole new dimension.  Power grabs, empire building, scapegoating, and undermining other teams are openly on display without appropriate action (and sometimes not even a reaction) from local management.  The one transgression not on display, by virtue of its definition, is backstabbing (which also happens quite often). 

There are some that complain about too many processes.  This is not a start-up anymore.  There is a lack of the right kind of processes that can propel an organization to efficiently reach its business goals.  Removing the brakes so that one team can work faster without fully appreciating the impacts on other teams results in a longer time to reach the organization's business objectives.

-  Roche appears to be centralizing all of their South Bay and Peninsula M&A targets at the Santa Clara site and turning it into an ""Innovation Center"".  Could be a good opportunity to be able to transfer across many teams.","- Toxic work culture and management.  Employees are sometimes publicly berated in meetings.  Weekly meeting(s) are masqueraded as somewhere to share data and information across groups, but actually function as arenas where groups face off against each other vying for power and recognition.  Back-stabbing and back-biting of teams against each other is commonplace.  Fear, competition, and mistrust permeate the entire organization.
- Lack of concrete direction and strategy from executive and senior management leads to entire site scrambling for goals and direction every year.
- ""Innovate Now"" and ""Speak Up"" are two of the cultural beliefs, but almost no one is allowed to do anything innovative or out of the box.  Anything that bucks the status quo is immediately met with resistance.  ""We already tried that and it didn't work"", and then not having any data to back up claims seems to be the default response.  People catch on quickly, stop trying to contribute new ideas, turn on ""coast mode"", and become ""yes"" men or women.
- Salaries are consistently below what other companies Pharma, Biotech, or Technology companies in the Bay Area are offering even though HR claims they are performing salary comparisons.  People leaving for new opportunities regularly secure 30-40% compensation increases.  Stock options are only offered to a select group of software engineers, data scientists or directors and above, good luck everyone else!
- Contractors are treated like second-hand citizens, and I have seen many cut loose before their contracts are up.  I even witnessed one case where the contractor was given only 4 days of notice before being told they were being let go.
- Points above lead to a large number of disengaged workers that are trapped and looking for a way out.

Some of the directors and senior managers are not competent (many are though).  

The incompetent ones are the obvious elephants in the room, but upper management doesn't seem to reprimand appropriately, and prefers to sweep it under the rug with a guise of using the Culture of Accountability versus tackling the problem head on.  

The incompetent middle management personality types fall into two main categories: they are either never around, or they are micro-managers who don't know what they are talking about and mask their ignorance and incompetence by questioning and talking condescendingly to functional study team members.   

The micro-managers get so wrapped up in details of everything, but they're never around to know the details so they endlessly scrutinize all the work the study teams performs which inevitably stresses out the team members who deal with the details and study work on a daily basis. It would be one thing if they understood processes and had valid, constructive feedback and points to make, but they question and scrutinize for the sake of hiding their own lack of knowledge and to feed their superiority complexes at the end of the day so they can go home feeling accomplished for doing something other than complaining and pushing emails all day.

The micro-managers also have a double standard of what they require of functional study team staff compared to what they provide themselves. They require transparency but do not complete the flow by being transparent downward (even to their own staff); They harp other functional areas to complete dependencies sooner than expected to compensate for their own delays in timelines.

In the past 6 years, my job was impacted 4-5 times.   I had to either apply for a new job or take a package and leave.  All of these were due to OPEX realignment of personnel.

The Nutley location was closed down after 100 years of service and the US headquarters shifted to Genentech.    

The merger of Roche and Genentech has not been the smoothest.  Each company is still a separate entity and supported by different IT departments.

Roche is extremely process driven, cost conscious (with regards to IT) and doesn't like to deviate.  Gene is agile and flexible with the mentality of ""get the work done as quick as possible.""

This site does not take care of employees. It is not the mission of the Site to keep people / Talent. That explains the high grade of people rotation. Every month people are leaving and new ones are coming. 

There is a big lack of structure, this makes difficult to work for the department and to understand what they expect from you.

Flexibility concept of this site have a total different meaning here many times. It means that you need to be flexible for working at 18.00, 19.00, 20.00, 22.00, etc. They sell it as something good but it is not the case because of that reason. 

 Even though they say the opposite and they really believe it, there is still the culture of, if your boss is in the office you must stay in the office till he leaves. The Digital Hub and Diabetes in general works like a big Silo. This means that if you are expecting to be able to make a career from here forget about it. Maybe Roche Diagnostics (in San Cugat as well) it is different and it is worth to try.
 
If you want to live in Barcelona, then it will take at least 1hour by public transport to reach the site. It does not matter where you live in the city. At the end of the day it always take 1 hour (forget about the car because of traffic jams).

Work life balance and benefits are pretty good.  Compensation is average.  Facilities are managed quite well.  Free snacks are available though that may change once the new cafeteria is ready.,"By far the biggest drawback is the toxic work culture and weak management.  There are a number of managers who do not have their employees' back, leaving them to fend for themselves until they either become toxic themselves as a survival mechanism, or leave the company in time so that self-healing can begin.

Politics is par for the course - yet it is the intensity level that takes it to a whole new dimension.  Power grabs, empire building, scapegoating, and undermining other teams are openly on display without appropriate action (and sometimes not even a reaction) from local management.  The one transgression not on display, by virtue of its definition, is backstabbing (which also happens quite often). 

There are some that complain about too many processes.  This is not a start-up anymore.  There is a lack of the right kind of processes that can propel an organization to efficiently reach its business goals.  Removing the brakes so that one team can work faster without fully appreciating the impacts on other teams results in a longer time to reach the organization's business objectives.

Some of the directors and senior managers are not competent (many are though).  

The incompetent ones are the obvious elephants in the room, but upper management doesn't seem to reprimand appropriately, and prefers to sweep it under the rug with a guise of using the Culture of Accountability versus tackling the problem head on.  

The incompetent middle management personality types fall into two main categories: they are either never around, or they are micro-managers who don't know what they are talking about and mask their ignorance and incompetence by questioning and talking condescendingly to functional study team members.   

The micro-managers get so wrapped up in details of everything, but they're never around to know the details so they endlessly scrutinize all the work the study teams performs which inevitably stresses out the team members who deal with the details and study work on a daily basis. It would be one thing if they understood processes and had valid, constructive feedback and points to make, but they question and scrutinize for the sake of hiding their own lack of knowledge and to feed their superiority complexes at the end of the day so they can go home feeling accomplished for doing something other than complaining and pushing emails all day.

The micro-managers also have a double standard of what they require of functional study team staff compared to what they provide themselves. They require transparency but do not complete the flow by being transparent downward (even to their own staff); They harp other functional areas to complete dependencies sooner than expected to compensate for their own delays in timelines.

Consequently, top talent frequently leaves the company and this is weakening their sales and marketing strength. And if you're a woman in the organization, your chances of being promoted to a management position are slim. This is a company that actually has an MBO to promote women into management roles. What does that tell you about how women are really thought of at Roche? If you're a man and you know how to mob your staff, your chances of getting ahead are far more increased.

My advice is if  you are working for Roche in the IT area, you are at risk of yearly stress of losing your job due to restructuring and sending jobs around the company/world.  In the past 6 years, my job was impacted 4-5 times.   I had to either apply for a new job or take a package and leave.  All of these were due to OPEX realignment of personnel.  Senior management would move head count from one location to another without always understanding what they were doing.  The latest push in the US is to send IT to Genentech in CA, Madrid, Spain or back to Basel, Switzerland.  The Nutley location was closed down after 100 years of service and the US headquarters shifted to Genentech.    

The merger of Roche and Genentech has not been the smoothest.  Each company is still a separate entity and supported by different IT departments.  

Genentech has not experienced the headcount loss experience as of my last day.  They are in for a shock once it does.    You have to keep in mind that Roche is the typical Swiss based company, and Gene is the typical San Francisco company.  They are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum.    Roche is extremely process driven, cost conscious (with regards to IT) and doesn't like to deviate.  Gene is agile and flexible with the mentality of ""get the work done as quick as possible.""  They don't let cost act as barrier necessarily.  Gene is able to bypass process and make their internal customers happy with rapid turn around times.

Let me give you some example: SIS was created and nothing came out for 2 year and now they reorganize it again and in the whole process the incompetent managers just kept rising their positions.

All in all and from my experience, I would just advise not to work in the site (not in Roche as a company but just in this location)","Sant Cugat Digital Hub (just talking about my experience there) :
This site does not take care of employees. It is not the mission of the Site to keep people / Talent. That explains the high grade of people rotation. Every month people are leaving and new ones are coming. 

There is a big lack of structure, this makes difficult to work for the department and to understand what they expect from you.

Flexibility concept of this site have a total different meaning here many times. It means that you need to be flexible for working at 18.00, 19.00, 20.00, 22.00, etc. They sell it as something good but it is not the case because of that reason. 

 Even though they say the opposite and they really believe it, there is still the culture of, if your boss is in the office you must stay in the office till he leaves. The Digital Hub and Diabetes in general works like a big Silo. This means that if you are expecting to be able to make a career from here forget about it. Maybe Roche Diagnostics (in San Cugat as well) it is different and it is worth to try.
 
If you want to live in Barcelona, then it will take at least 1hour by public transport to reach the site. It does not matter where you live in the city. At the end of the day it always take 1 hour (forget about the car because of traffic jams).

Unless you're a certain someone's favorite, or one of the manager's favorites. Management is barely there in the lab. I have heard QA department ask us so many times, where's our management? To the point where if I had a penny for every time I been asked, I wouldn't be working here, and invest those millions into something else. Work most of the time can get done rather quickly, but it's due to management not being there that stalls the progress, 80% of the time.  Process within the lab is sloppy, and the higher up in QC is aware of this, and says it should be fixed. Every time the FDA, or Novartis does an  audit, the management is quick to hide the glaring major issues, and pretend there's nothing wrong, and the lab is back to square 1. Management likes to do this thing where they'll just pick on an employee, and make their week miserable. They'll task them impossible tasks, and they're aware they can't complete it, and warn them it'll affect their performance. Sometimes, the tasks will cause overtime and will punish employees for staying in late, or hint for them not to take in overtime. There’s a perception that if you’re outside of the lab, may it be for food, or your required 15 minute break. Unless you’re the favorite, you will be called down to the office and get yelled at. The lab is known to have a toxic community, which is promoted. There’s plenty of times when management will join in on hazing as well. The main consensus in the lab is the majority feel they’re overworked, they’re depressed, they’re ignored. Many of these issues are well known and have been brought up to HR, but nothing apparent has been done. We have been told to bring it up to BPO as well, but nothing apparent has been done, just an automated message.

The department I joined emphasized project leadership For new PhD-level hires, a tremendous growth opportunity in the right context, but was not provided a seasoned mentor (or any mentor) to help develop and implement the incredibly  complex process of pre-clinical drug discovery. I felt alone and overwhelmed by the task and expectations, and was assigned a team without my input and without consent or volunteering by the team members. The breadth of experience on the team was excellent (medicinal chemist, cell biologist, in vivo pharmacologist, translational medicine expert, and high-throughput screening expert), but because they were strictly assigned, oftentimes the scientists had little-to-no inherent interest in helping with my “exploratory project”. Thrown in the middle of the ocean without being taught how to swim... Not great! Importantly, this was a departmental initiative and not a global one. Just illustrates what I imagine is common in large corporations; that the employee experience is wholly dependent on the department, the individual unit you’re a part of, and your direct manager.

Most of the focus and discussions are on budget and reporting, and the HR systems are merely transactional with superficial people development plans and systems ( a lot of blah blah and nice pictures, but fear to ask and get involved from HR).

Expectations are flip-flopped, people are thrown under the bus, feedback is not provided but then they escalate everything and claim deficiencies when they never brought it up or pointed out they thought there was a gap so it could be addressed. Talk about hostile environments - certain members of the team speak about people in the same room negatively in Spanish right in front of them, without realizing that some of them understand what's being said about them. Our management couldn't support us enough to protect us from the BU's tendencies of making us work around the clock with 18-20 hour days, 7 days a week, and it's not seasonal - it's year-round. One week changes are made and approved, the next week it's like a complete 180 happened and everyone has to scramble constantly. Despite working around the clock and delivering a powerful presentation, positive recognition is lacking. Most people working with this team have been chased away single-handedly and if the remaining team members are still there, then no doubt they will be leaving soon.

Novartis,,Current Employee ,,"If you want to learn a lot in a short amount of time, then Novartis is the place to go. For example, one year at Novartis is about 3 years of experience anywhere else.  It will help your overall well-roundedness in clinical research because the roles at Novartis are very broad, allowing you an opportunity to learn a lot of different things.  It is a good place to get experience in a job, and experience in how to deal with politics.  Both are skills one would need to get to the next level at any company.

Good pipeline, peers are generally very nice people, and available training is good.  The Pay for performance is generally good.  If you stay true to type, ""perky and happy to be there with no criticisms (even when asked)"", and volunteer for more activities, you will do well.  

Benefits, vacation policy, flexible working arrangements are relatively good as well.","Novartis can be perceived as a very political environment.  Management sometimes gets stuck on how something is said versus the content of the message.  If you communicate well, you will do well at Novartis.  If you have difficulties in communicating, then you will have some difficulties..

The same personality type, unfortunately, is generally seen across most levels of management  (i.e., over ambitious, insecure, argumentative, aggressive, condescending to subordinates, and above all arrogant) and this severely impacts employee morale.  It is perceived by regular associates that most at these levels are looking to maintain their power, not help train their successors.  

Workload for everyone is much too high.  You will be expected to make things happen by ""magic"" even if it is not your job.  Some line functions wait for others to tell them what to do in fear of doing something wrong.  Environment is a negative feedback culture - and cases where the associate is not given the benefit of the doubt.  I have viewed a lot of ""scapegoating"" occurring in my 10 years at Novartis.

Commitment to 'diversity' contributes to keeping  toxic coworkers thus affecting people and projects negatively.
Antiquated review and rating system where a lot can get missed and managers can take a few words out of context from a multirater and greaty distort the intent of the contents due to their lack of understanding of a person's contribution to the overall project and their lack of understanding of a role's interaction with other line functions.

But if three people were not working at all of if they quit and there were vacancies in the team, we would still be held to the same sales goals.

At the lower levels there is a huge reliance on contract workers, which is fine for simple execution, but a contractor can't fix the broken workflow or lead a misguided project.  They aren't responsible for changing culture.  That has to come from within. 

In terms of perks and benefits, nothing special.   Negotiate heavily, as there is a huge need and they will absolutely budge.  There is no 401k matching.  There is a small pension but it takes a few years to vest into, which isn't very attractive when there is such high turnover or if you are a contractor.  No gym.  No cafeteria.

Still better than most big pharma in keeping political in fighting to a dull roar.","Most glass door reviews are dismissed as sour grapes from disgruntled employees.  And direct managers are usually blamed for disgruntled employees.  For full disclosure, I want to say that I am disgruntled:  but mostly I am reviewing a bigger picture:  my small situation is too complex to describe, and I do not blame my manager for the situation, though I don't understand some of his actions.

I am writing because I found out yesterday, that people in an upstream group from mine are regularly working 12 hours a day.  The most direct impact on me is that I am asked to make plans and requests for capital and FTE to do a world class job and to help other divisions in the company, but it is disheartening when there is a limited budget and an upstream group need the resources more just to have a regular life again.  This is compounded by the regular expectation that everyone should fight and argue for their little empire in a company:  which is regular business practice everywhere.
Meanwhile the company is hiring further upstream.  Nobody in the European sites are working 12 hour days (it is illegal there as far as I can tell).  BI had a big out-licensing deal, laid off medicinal chemistry in Ridgefield, but our budgets and headcount remain flat.  Most of the equipment left from medicinal chemistry was transferred to Europe or sold at auction to support an upper manager's in-licensing  ambitions.  For pennies on the dollar, equipment that could be used by current BI employees was disposed at auction to try to bring in outside projects and the labs sit empty while the rest of us are still squished like sardines in our labs.   If we had the capacity to finish those outside projects, why did we sell our best project to another company?  
At the root of this, management says BI cannot survive unless it becomes first in class and more innovative and also at the same time reduces the percent spend on research to what some ""consultants"" said was the ""benchmark percentage"" of top performing companies.
My only conclusion is that deep down, they want the current scientists to leave and think they can hire better ones, or in-license better projects, or can not tell when an upper manager does only what she can claim credit for, not what is best for the company as a whole.
Business politics drives the company instead of science.  I can't do my job if the group upstream of me can't do theirs.  My whole larger group can't do their job is early research doesn't give us projects with good biology.  And if people keep leaving, there won't be enough long-timers left to get anything done.",20-Aug-17,I have been working at Boehringer Ingelheim full-time for more than 5 years,"""Do not value Scientists:  Budget to Benchmark is the Guiding Principle""",2

BI has to do a better job at promoting the virtues of the Company. I've worked at one of those companies, and BI is definitely better with respect to work environment and challenging work.

As others have noted, the Company is very conservative, and the US business seems to be in the shadow of the German headquarters. The cultures are quite different - the US being more agile and transparent. Hopefully the German management will recognize the benefits of being more agile - I've never worked at a company that had so many layers of approvals and redundant meetings.

Changes were implemented without voice of the customer- impact assessments.  As a result, there was a high turn over rate.  Morale tanked - no one seemed to care.  It was all about the new Director's agenda which was validated by the higher-ups. 
The corporate culture was a coaching culture which included feedback.  Feedback was acceptable as long as it came top down.  It was not encouraged or accepted if feedback (negative specifically) was dispensed bottom-up.  If management received negative feedback, management would find a way to retaliate.
